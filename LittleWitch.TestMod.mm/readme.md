# TestMod

A test mod to test IkenFeline with. Contains the following patches:
- skips splash screens to speed up testing
- adds a "Mods" button to the title screen, but it just opens the regular options menu
- Changes the AbilityIgnite to have infinite range and target everyone, but in the process making you lose control of who you target

## Instructions

Build, move `LittleWitch.TestMod.mm.dll` to the `IkenFeline/mods` folder in the game directory (may need to make this folder).
